# ivy-reporting-ide
Optional BIRT reporting capabilities for the Axon.ivy designer. 

## Mission
This is a CodeCamp prototype that aims to show how easy rarely used designer features could be separated into extra projects. With huge benefits: 
- the standard designer bundle could be slacked down and therefore becomes easier to download and test
- the target platform looses huge birt dependencies (which maybe also simplifies the update to newer platforms)
