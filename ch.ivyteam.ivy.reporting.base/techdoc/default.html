<h1>Subproject
Reporitng Base</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
This plugin contains classes that provide access to Ivy Project Report
creation. Furthermore it cotains the&nbsp;encapsulation of
a&nbsp;Birt engines to execute arbitrary reports and
to create, access and modify Birt Report
Designs and Libraries.<br>
<h2>Birt Engine API</h2>
To retrieve a BirtRuntimeManager one has to use the
BirtRuntimeManagerFactory. It provides a singleton instance of the
BirtRuntimeManager which can created the first time by calling
<span style="font-style: italic;">createBirtRuntimeManger</span>
or simply retrieved by <span style="font-style: italic;">getBirtRuntimeManager</span>.
To create a BirtRuntimeManager a IApplicationConfigurationManager is
needed, in order to set the System Property that may be used to change
the Birt reporting engine home directory.<br>
The BirtRuntimeManager is used to start, stop and provide the Birt
Report&nbsp;and Design Engine. <br>
Beside the ReportEngine and the DesignEngine, which are sufficient for
nearly everything that can be done with Birt, the BirtRuntimeManage
also provides some utility methods as <span style="font-style: italic;">getDesignParameters</span>
to retrieve
the parameters of a report design file, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">getAvailableThemes</span>
that
provides the themes that are provided by a report design and its
referenced libraries and <span style="font-style: italic;">createSimpleReport</span>
which allows to create a
simple report by providing the report name, path, formats and design
file.<br>
From the outside of this package the BirtRuntimeManager should only be
accessed via its Interface IBirtRuntimeManager.<br>
Exceptions that are thrown from the BirtRuntime plugin are packed into
a BirtRuntimeException.
<h2>Birt Engine Problems</h2>
Because of a <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=281865">Bug
in the Birt Engine</a>
there are currently problems restarting a the Birt Engines. The current
workaround for this is that the BirtRuntime is never stopped. Please
fix the <span style="font-style: italic;">stop()</span>
code and the corresponding tests as soon as this issue is fixed.<br>
<h2>Report Creation Process</h2>
In order to create a report, a ReportingManager is required, which can
by retrieved through its ReportingManagerFactory. The ReportingManager
provides a runAndRenderReport(ReportConfiguration) method which does
the actual report creation. How, where and with what data the report is
to be created is described in the ReportConfiguration, which is passed
as argument to this method. (See <a href="#Report_Configurations">Report
Configurations</a>)<br>
<br>
The first thing that is done when creating a report is to fetch the
Data that is to be reported. This is done by an instance of the
ReportDataCollector
which fetches the Data from the Xpert.Ivy Data Model and creates
ReportDataEntries for every Report Element to be created. (See <a
 href="#About_Report_Data_Entries">About
Report Data Entries</a>)<br>
All the Report Data is then cached in the *ReportData lists of the
ReportDataCollector, which is accessible through the ReportingManager.
The filtering of the Process Model Elements (e.g. Processes,
RichDialogs, DataClasses, etc.) that should be included in the report
is described in the ReportElementFilter which can be found in the
ReportConfiguration.<br>
<br>
After the report data is retrieved the report design file (*.rptdesign)
is opened and the right theme for the report is set. <br>
Then the parameters of the report are set and the report is filled with
data, resulting in&nbsp;a report document
(*.rptdocument). Where the data for the report has to be fetched from
is defined by the data sets of the report design. The EventHandlerClass
Property of a dataset points to the Class, which must implement
ReportingDataSetEventAdapter, that is to be called to get to the report
data.<br>
When the filled report document has been created, it can be rendered to
the requested output formats.<br>
All exceptions that are thrown from the Reporting Plugin to the
'outside world' are of type ReportingException and wrap the original
Exception if there is any.<br>
<h2><a name="About_Report_Data_Entries"></a>About
Report Data Entries</h2>
A *ReportDataEntry contains the information for a&nbsp;smallest
size
data entry in the report. E.g. a ProcessReportDataEntry contains the
data of
&nbsp;single Process Element. This includes Process, ProcessGroup,
Process Image and the Process Element Data of this Process Element.
<br>
This implies that multiple&nbsp;ProcessReportDataEntries carry,
redundantly, the data of the same ancestors
(that is
Process, Process Group and Process Image). The reason why this has been
solved like this, is that otherwise, every hierarchical level within
a the Process Model would require a new DataSet in the report with a
new DataSetEventAdapter class. Each DataSet of the report would then
again need to be linked against it's parent (e.g. process model to
application). This would result in a lot of more work to create a
report design for the benefit of a slightly faster report generation.<br>
But if report creation is too slow consider adding more normalized
DataSets.<br>
<h2><a name="Report_Configurations"></a>Report
Configurations</h2>
A ReportConfiguration contains the information that is used to create a
report. That is formats, file system root, report name, design, theme,
filter, details, title, header, footer and logo. Such a report
configuration may also be persisted to an xml file. Therefore the
ReportingManager provides a <span style="font-style: italic;">persistReportConfiguration(ReportConfiguration,
String)</span> and a <span style="font-style: italic;">loadReportConfiguration(String)
</span>method to save, respectively
load and return a ReportConfiguration to/from a given path.<br>
The XML Schema for the ReportConfiguration can be found in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Designer/reporting/configurations/XMLSchema/reportingConfig.xsd.</span><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span></small>
<h2>Process Image Generators</h2>
In order for the Reporting Plugin to generate images of processes an
implementor of IProcessImageGenerator has to be registered in the
ImageGeneratorRegistry. The reason why the image generator is not
directly in the reporting plugin is, that it currently depends on some
designer specific code which would result in cyclic dependencies
between the plugins and therefore had to be moved up to the Designer
(ch.ivyteam.ivy.designer.process.util.ProcessImageGenerator.java). The
Server does currently not register an IProcessImageGenerator, because
the code that generates the image is designer specific and it may not
be possible to create AWT images on the server when no Graphical
Environment is available. But this remains to be tested. Code that
checks whether image creation is possible and registers the
IProcessImageGenerator with the Reporting plugin from the Server
remains to be implemented.<br>

<h2>Creating a new Reporting
*.rptdesign File</h2>
<h3>Get the Birt Report Designer</h3>
To create a new report design (*.rptdesign) which can be used by the
reporting plugin you need to install a Birt Report Designer. It exists
a standalone version (Look at <a
 href="http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/">http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/</a>)
and as Eclipse Plugin which can be installed via a (normally
preinstalled) update Site.<br>
<h3><a name="Access_to_Xpert.ivy_data"></a>Create
a report that has access to all the Xpert.Ivy data</h3>
To create a new Report in Eclipse (using the Report Design
Perspective): <span style="font-style: italic;">New -&gt; Other...
-&gt; Report</span>.
Then create a blank report. To let the report use the datasets, themes
and parameters that will be handed to it upon report creation, we have
to to open the ResourceExplorer View and navigate to <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Designer/reporting/designs/Xpert.ivy.rptlibrary</span>
and right click -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">Use Library...</span>.
Now you should see the Library in the Outline. Now, still&nbsp;in
the
Resource Explorer, open the library&nbsp;and select each Report
Parameter, Data Source and DataSet and right click -&gt; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Add to Report</span>.
If you want to you can also apply a theme to your new report design,
but this can also be done via right click on the shown report
design-&gt; Theme-&gt;ApplyTheme or via our
ReportConfigurationUI,
which will show all the themes that are available by the libraries of
the report design.<br>
Congratulations, you now have a report that can use all the data that
is provided by Xpert.Ivy. Unfortunately it is still empty... :-(<br>
<h3>Fill the report with data from
a single data set</h3>
So, to get the data into the report you may create e.g. a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">table</span>
from the Palette View. This table can be linked to a dataset. I
recommend to link your initial table to IvyProjects. From the
DataExplorer view you can now select columns of the IvyProjects data
set and drag&amp;drop them into the detail row of the table.
However,
as the IvyProjects dataset is not normalized (See <a
 href="#About_Report_Data_Entries">About
Report Data Entries</a>),
the data of e.g. the Applications will be shown redundantly. To
overcome this ugliness, tables may contain groups. By right click on
the table -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">Insert Group</span>
you can create a new group an select on which data set column you may
want to group on (e.g. ApplicationName). Now you can add Application
informations to the Application Group and ProcessModel information to
the Details to get a nice hierarchy. Now you can hierarchically fill a
report with data from a single data set. But what if we want also have
the process data in the report, which is in a separate data set?<br>
<h3>Linking data sets together</h3>
To nest a data set within another data set, e.g. nest the IvyProcesses
within the IvyProjects, we create another table, but this time within
the other table. Again we have to select a DataSet binding, e.g.
IvyProcesses. To have a linking between the outer data set(IvyProjects)
and the inner data set(IvyProcesses), we have to right click on the
inner table-&gt;<span style="font-style: italic;">Edit Data Binding</span>,
click the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data
Set Parameter Binding...</span>
Button and double click the <span style="font-style: italic;">parentVersionName</span>
Parameter. Now we can hand the inner data set a column from the outer
data set, e.g. select <span style="font-style: italic;">Fx -&gt;
Available
Column Bindings -&gt; Table -&gt; VersionName</span>,
double click. Now you have <span style="font-style: italic;">row["VersionName"]</span>
set as expression, and every time this data set is opened, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">VersionName </span>of
the ProcessModelVersion will be set as argument for the data set. The
actual filtering of the Processes is then done in the
ProcessDataSetEventAdapter.<br>
<h3>What about the parameters?</h3>
You now may wonder what all those Report Parameters, which you linked
to your report design, are all about. If you look at the outline of
your report design, you can see 5 report parameters: Technical Details,
Title, Header, Footer, FromDesigner. Each is used for a certain task in
the report, which is described here:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Technical Details is a
boolean flag that indicates whether
technical details of the report should be shown. When it is false, all
technical information of the report is hidden. This is done by setting
the Visibility property of table rows with&nbsp;technical details
to Hide, when the Expression <span style="font-style: italic;">!params["Technical
Details"].value </span>evaluates
to true. To do so click on a table row -&gt; PropertyEditor View
-&gt;
Visibility -&gt; click Hide Element -&gt; write Expression.</li>
  <li>Title, Header and Footer are
String parameters that are used for
the Master Page header and footer, and the subtitle of the title page
in the layout.</li>
  <li>FromDesigner is a boolean
parameter that indicates whether this
report was created from the Designer or the Server. It is currently
used to hide the application when the report was generated from the
Designer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other curiosities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Why has the default report
two tables of content? <br>
A linked one for HTML and PDF and one without links for DOC. This is
because Birt does not provide a table of contents for all report
formats, but only for PDF (as PDF Bookmarks) and for HTML when viewed
in the BirtReportViewer.<br>
  </li>
  <li>What about those Styles and
Themes? <br>
Themes are somehow like a CSS File. Themes define how elements of a
report have to look like (e.g. font, size, color, &nbsp;background,
etc.). Every report can have single theme. A theme consists of multiple
styles. A style describes how the an element of a report has to look
like. So, you have to define for each element (e.g. a table, a title,
the whole report) which style it may have. The styles may also be
cascaded like css and can also be imported from css.<br>

  <li>Birt que? No
comprendo!&nbsp;Help!!!<br>

<h2>Extending the Report Library
to support other Xpert.Ivy Data Elements</h2>
Let's assume Xpert.Ivy gained a new Process Model Element. Let's call
it <span style="font-style: italic;">CoffeeMachineConfiguration</span>.
To add this new CoffeeMachineConfiguration to a report there are
several things that have to be done, as creating a new
DataSetEventAdapter, creating a new dataset in the Xpert.ivy
library&nbsp;and linking the reports against the new data set. How
this
works in detail is described here.<br>
<br>
First we have to create a new
CoffeeMachineConfigurationDataSetEventAdapter Class, which extends
ReportingDataSetEventAdapter, which provides access to the
ReportDataCollector. <br>
This&nbsp;CoffeeMachineConfigurationDataSetEventAdapter must
implement a <span style="font-style: italic;">open()</span>method
which is called before a data set is
used. In the open method you can fetch an iterator over
your&nbsp;CoffeeMachineConfigurations and make it available to the
fetch method. On the other hand you could also retrieve all the
CoffeeMachineConfigurations from the ReportDataCollector and cache them
there.<br>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">fetch()</span>
method fills one
row of the data set with data and returns true if there is more more to
be done and false if it has filled everything. In this method you can
fetch all the attributes of your CoffeeMachineConfiguration (as e.g.
coffee strength, coffee size, hasWater, hasCoffeeBeans, etc...) and
write them to the row of your data set. When fetching the
CoffeeMachineConfigurations they may also be filtered by&nbsp;the
parameters that are handed to this
dataset. For all data sets that appear within the IvyProjects data set
this is currently the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">parentVersionName</span>
parameter, which can be used to check if
the&nbsp;CoffeeMachineConfiguration belongs to the given
ProcessModelVersion name.<br>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">close()
</span>method can cleanup everything
at the end.<br>
<br>
After having created the
new&nbsp;CoffeeMachineConfigurationDataSetEventAdapter we have to
add
it to the library and the report. To do this, we open the report
library <span style="font-style: italic;">(Xpert.ivy.rptlibrary)</span>
and create a new data set (e.g. IvyCoffeeMachines) and create all the
Columns that are needed for this DataSet (e.g. CoffeeStrength,
CoffeeSize, HasWater, HasCoffeeBeans, etc.), which will be filled in
the DataSetEventAdapter fetch method, and also add a new parameter,
which will be accessible in the DataSetEventAdapter via <span
 style="font-style: italic;">dataSet.getInputParameterValue("theParameterName").</span>
Then we have to link the report data set to
our&nbsp;CoffeeMachineConfigurationDataSetEventAdapter by selecting
the
data set -&gt; select the Property Editor View -&gt; Event
Handler
-&gt; select your DataSetEventAdapter. Now your DataSetEventAdapter
will be called when information from this data set is required. <br>
The only thing that is left to do is to link this data set to your
report file. How this may be done is already described in the <a
 href="#Access_to_Xpert.ivy_data">Create
a report that has access to all the Xpert.Ivy data</a>&nbsp;chapter.<br>
<h2>API</h2>
The ReportingManagerFactory is the main access point to the
ReportingManager. The Reporting manager creates for every Report that
is created a ReportDataCollector which fetches the report data from the
Ivy Data Model. For the ReportDataCollector to create images the
Designer or Server need to register an Implementation of
IProcessImageGenerator at the ImageGeneratorRegistry. Most
ReportDataEntries are created by the ReportDataCollector and are also
cached there for later use by the DataSetEventAdapters. The
DataSetEventAdapters are invoked upon the filling of the report design,
as the report design has defined which DataSets rely on which
DataSetEventAdapters.&nbsp;<br>
